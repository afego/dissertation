abstract = {Homogenization is a technique commonly used in multiscale computational science and engineering for predicting collective response of heterogeneous materials and extracting effective mechanical properties. In this paper, a three-dimensional deep convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) is proposed to predict the anisotropic effective material properties for representative volume elements (RVEs) with random inclusions. The high-fidelity dataset generated by a computational homogenization approach is used for training the 3D-CNN models. The inference results of the trained networks on unseen data indicate that the network is capable of capturing the microstructural features of RVEs and produces an accurate prediction of effective stiffness and Poisson’s ratio. The benefits of the 3D-CNN over conventional finite-element-based homogenization with regard to computational efficiency, uncertainty quantification and model’s transferability are discussed in sequence. We find the salient features of the 3D-CNN approach make it a potentially suitable alternative for facilitating material design with fast product design iteration and efficient uncertainty quantification.}

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Cross-entropy is a widely used loss function in applications. It coincides with the logistic loss applied to the outputs of a neural network, when the softmax is used. But, what guarantees can we rely on when using cross-entropy as a surrogate loss? We present a theoretical analysis of a broad family of loss functions, comp-sum losses, that includes cross-entropy (or logistic loss), generalized cross-entropy, the mean absolute error and other cross-entropy-like loss functions. We give the first H-consistency bounds for these loss functions. These are non-asymptotic guarantees that upper bound the zero-one loss estimation error in terms of the estimation error of a surrogate loss, for the specific hypothesis set H used. We further show that our bounds are tight. These bounds depend on quantities called minimizability gaps. To make them more explicit, we give a specific analysis of these gaps for comp-sum losses. We also introduce a new family of loss functions, smooth adversarial comp-sum losses, that are derived from their comp-sum counterparts by adding in a related smooth term. We show that these loss functions are beneficial in the adversarial setting by proving that they admit H- consistency bounds. This leads to new adversarial robustness algorithms that consist of minimizing a regularized smooth adversarial comp-sum loss. While our main purpose is a theoretical analysis, we also present an extensive empirical analysis comparing comp-sum losses. We further report the results of a series of experiments demonstrating that our adversarial robustness algorithms outperform the current state-of-the-art, while also achieving a superior non-adversarial accuracy.},
